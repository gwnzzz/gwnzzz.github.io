## About Laufey 
Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir (/ˈleɪveɪ/ LAY-vay, Icelandic: [ˈlœyːvei ˈliːn ˈjounstouhtɪr̥]; born 23 April 1999), known by the mononym Laufey, is an Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter.[2] She achieved prominence in the early 2020s for her success as an upcoming jazz artist, with critics noting that her jazz-inflected songs have received considerable success for a genre that has largely declined commercially.
Having performed as a cello soloist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra at age 15, Laufey was a finalist on Ísland Got Talent (2014) and semi-finalist on The Voice Iceland (2015). In 2021, she released her debut EP, Typical of Me, and graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, United States. Laufey's debut album, Everything I Know About Love, was released in 2022 and charted in Iceland and the US. It was followed by Bewitched, which was released in 2023 to critical acclaim and earned her a Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album nomination at the 2024 Grammy Awards; the single "From the Start" found moderate success in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Laufey has cited Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, and Taylor Swift as sources of influence.
